# Claude Terraform Plan Review GitHub Action

Automated Terraform plan review and analysis using Claude AI.

## Overview

This GitHub Action provides automated, intelligent reviews of Terraform plans within pull requests using Claude AI. It features:

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Reviews complete Terraform plans regardless of size
- **Alignment Validation**: Checks that planned changes match PR code modifications
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies destructive changes, drift, and unexpected modifications
- **Clear Communication**: Posts structured, readable reviews directly on PRs
- **Non-Blocking**: Can be configured to provide feedback without blocking merges

## Quick Start

Create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/terraform-plan.yml`):

```yaml
name: Terraform Plan & Review

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  plan:
    name: Terraform Plan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3
        with:
          cli_config_credentials_token: ${{ secrets.TF_API_TOKEN }}

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: |
          terraform plan -no-color 2>&1 | tee plan_output.txt

      - name: Upload Plan for Review
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: terraform-plan
          path: plan_output.txt
          retention-days: 1

  review:
    name: AI Plan Review
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: plan
    if: ${{ always() && needs.plan.result != 'cancelled' }}
    continue-on-error: true
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Download Terraform Plan
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: terraform-plan
          path: /tmp

      - name: Claude Terraform Plan Review
        uses: WalletConnect/actions/claude/terraform-plan-review@master
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          terraform_plan_file: /tmp/plan_output.txt
```

## Prerequisites

1. **Anthropic API Key**: Obtain an API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. **Repository Secret**: Add your API key as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in repository secrets
3. **Permissions**: Ensure the workflow has the required permissions (see examples below)

## Required Permissions

The review job requires these GitHub token permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write      # Required for Claude authentication via OIDC
  contents: read       # Required to read repository files
  pull-requests: write # Required to post review comments on PRs
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: If your job defines its own `permissions` block, it overrides the workflow-level permissions. Always include all three permissions in the job.

## Inputs

| Input                    | Required | Default                      | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `anthropic_api_key`      | ‚úÖ       | -                            | Your Anthropic API key for Claude access                         |
| `model`                  | ‚ùå       | `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` | Claude model to use for reviews                                  |
| `terraform_plan_file`    | ‚úÖ       | -                            | Path to file containing the Terraform plan output                |
| `terraform_plan_log_file`| ‚ùå       | -                            | Path to file containing Terraform plan logs (warnings/errors)    |

## Usage Examples

### Recommended: Non-Blocking Separate Job

This pattern ensures the plan job completes quickly while the AI review runs independently without blocking merges:

```yaml
name: Terraform Plan & Review

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  plan:
    name: Terraform Plan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3
        with:
          cli_config_credentials_token: ${{ secrets.TF_API_TOKEN }}

      - name: Terraform Init
        working-directory: terraform
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Plan
        working-directory: terraform
        run: |
          set -o pipefail
          terraform plan -no-color 2>&1 | tee plan_output.txt

      - name: Upload Plan for Review
        if: ${{ always() }}
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: terraform-plan
          path: terraform/plan_output.txt
          retention-days: 1

  review:
    name: AI Plan Review
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: plan
    if: ${{ always() && needs.plan.result != 'cancelled' }}
    continue-on-error: true  # Non-blocking: failures won't prevent PR merge
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Download Terraform Plan
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: terraform-plan
          path: /tmp

      - name: Claude Terraform Plan Review
        uses: WalletConnect/actions/claude/terraform-plan-review@master
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          terraform_plan_file: /tmp/plan_output.txt
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Plan job gets green checkmark immediately
- ‚úÖ Review runs in parallel without blocking
- ‚úÖ `continue-on-error: true` ensures review failures don't block merges
- ‚úÖ Developers get plan results quickly, review comes later

          name: terraform-plan
          path: terraform/plan_output.txt
          retention-days: 1

  review:
    name: AI Plan Review
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: plan
    if: ${{ always() && needs.plan.result != 'cancelled' }}
    continue-on-error: true
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Download Terraform Plan
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: terraform-plan
          path: /tmp

      - name: Claude Terraform Plan Review
        uses: WalletConnect/actions/claude/terraform-plan-review@master
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          terraform_plan_file: /tmp/plan_output.txt
```

### With Plan Logs (Warnings/Errors)

Include Terraform logs for more comprehensive reviews:

```yaml
- name: Terraform Plan
  working-directory: terraform
  run: |
    set -o pipefail
    terraform plan -no-color 2>&1 | tee plan_output.txt

- name: Upload Plan and Logs
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: terraform-plan
    path: |
      terraform/plan_output.txt
    retention-days: 1

# In review job:
- name: Claude Terraform Plan Review
  uses: WalletConnect/actions/claude/terraform-plan-review@master
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    terraform_plan_file: /tmp/plan_output.txt
    terraform_plan_log_file: /tmp/plan_output.txt  # Same file contains both
```

### Using with plan-terraform Action

If you're using the `plan-terraform` composite action, you can access the plan files via outputs:

```yaml
- name: Terraform Plan
  id: plan
  uses: WalletConnect/actions/actions/plan-terraform@master
  with:
    environment: production
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: us-east-1

- name: Claude Review
  uses: WalletConnect/actions/claude/terraform-plan-review@master
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    terraform_plan_file: ${{ steps.plan.outputs.plan-text-file }}
    terraform_plan_log_file: ${{ steps.plan.outputs.plan-log-file }}
```

## Review Output

The action posts a **concise summary** at the top of the comment with full details in a collapsible section to keep PRs clean and scannable.

### Summary (Always Visible)

```markdown
## üìä Terraform Plan Review

**Summary:**
- 5 resources to add, 0 to change, 3 to destroy
- Verdict: ‚úÖ Plan matches code changes
- Risk Level: Medium - Destroying 3 dev environment dashboards
```

### Full Analysis (Collapsible)

Click "üìã Full Analysis" to expand and see:

- **Plan Summary**: Resource counts and cost impact
- **Alignment Check**: 
  - ‚úÖ Expected changes matching PR code modifications
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Unexpected changes not explained by PR diff
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - üîç Potential drift or hidden dependencies
  - üî• Risky/destructive changes (force replacements, destroys, IAM)
  - üß≠ Warnings and errors from Terraform
- **Detailed Changes**: Complete list of all resources being modified

This format ensures PRs remain readable even with multiple plan reviews while preserving all analysis details.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Separate Jobs

Run the review in a separate job with `continue-on-error: true` to avoid blocking merges:

```yaml
review:
  needs: plan
  continue-on-error: true  # Non-blocking
```

### 2. Always Upload Plan as Artifact

Use artifacts to share the plan between jobs:

```yaml
- name: Upload Plan
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: terraform-plan
    path: terraform/plan_output.txt
    retention-days: 1  # Clean up after 1 day
```

### 3. Use if Conditions Wisely

Run the review even if the plan fails, but skip if cancelled:

```yaml
review:
  needs: plan
  if: ${{ always() && needs.plan.result != 'cancelled' }}
```

### 4. Set Appropriate Permissions

Always explicitly set required permissions at the job level:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write      # For Claude authentication
  contents: read       # To read repository
  pull-requests: write # To post comments
```

### 5. Handle Large Plans

The action automatically handles large plans by:
- Reading the full plan file (no size limits)
- Posting a truncated preview to PR comments
- Instructing Claude to read the complete file

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Unable to get ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL"**

Solution: Add `id-token: write` permission to the job:
```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write  # ‚Üê Required for Claude authentication
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

**"Argument list too long"**

This should not occur with the file-based approach. Ensure you're passing file paths, not content:
```yaml
# ‚úÖ Correct
terraform_plan_file: /tmp/plan_output.txt

# ‚ùå Incorrect (deprecated)
terraform_plan: ${{ steps.plan.outputs.stdout }}
```

**"No review posted"**

- Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret is set correctly
- Ensure `pull-requests: write` permission is granted
- Check that the plan file path is correct

**"Plan truncated"**

The PR comment may be truncated for readability, but Claude reviews the full plan. Check workflow logs for the complete review output.

### Getting Better Reviews

1. **Include Complete Plans**: Ensure stderr and warnings are captured
2. **Descriptive PR Descriptions**: Help Claude understand the intent
3. **Clear Commit Messages**: Provide context for changes
4. **Review Logs**: Check workflow logs for detailed analysis

## Security Considerations

### Credential Security

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Never hardcode your Anthropic API key in workflow files!

- ‚úÖ **Correct**: `${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`
- ‚ùå **Incorrect**: Hardcoding keys in YAML

### Plan Content

- Plans may contain sensitive data (resource names, configurations)
- Plan files are ephemeral (stored in artifacts with short retention)
- Review comments on PRs are visible to repository members
- Claude processes plans securely via Anthropic's API

### Permissions

The action requires minimal permissions:
- `id-token: write` - For OIDC authentication
- `contents: read` - To read repository files
- `pull-requests: write` - To post comments

## Migrating from Content-Based to File-Based

If you're upgrading from an older version that used `terraform_plan` (content) input:

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Claude Review
  uses: WalletConnect/actions/claude/terraform-plan-review@v1
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    terraform_plan: ${{ steps.plan.outputs.stdout }}
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Save Plan
  run: terraform plan -no-color > /tmp/plan.txt

- name: Claude Review
  uses: WalletConnect/actions/claude/terraform-plan-review@master
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    terraform_plan_file: /tmp/plan.txt
```
