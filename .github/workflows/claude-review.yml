            WalletConnect Actions Repository

            Purpose: Reusable GitHub composite actions and workflows for Terraform infrastructure, AWS ECS deployments, release automation, and AI PR reviews.

            Primary Entry Points
            - actions/deploy-terraform and actions/plan-terraform for infrastructure workflows
            - actions/deploy-ecs for ECS service deployments
            - terraform/ and aws/ directories contain lower-level building blocks
            - claude/auto-review wraps Anthropics claude-code-action for PR reviews

            Key Conventions for Review
            - All actions are composite with bash steps
            - Inputs use kebab-case; outputs are written via the GITHUB_OUTPUT file
            - Consumers should pin actions to a full 40-character commit SHA, not a branch
            - Prefer the working-directory field in steps over changing directories in scripts
            - Terraform usage: select environment via TF_WORKSPACE, run non-interactively, apply with auto-approve, and disable color output in CI
            - AWS usage: configure credentials with aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials v4 and require an explicit region
            - Grafana integration: temporary keys with short TTL and guaranteed cleanup using always

            Security and Compliance Expectations
            - Do not print or commit secrets; mask sensitive values in logs
            - Ensure cleanup of temporary credentials and keys
            - External domains in code or configs should be limited to reown.com, walletconnect.com, walletconnect.org

            Reviewer Focus for This Repository
            - Backward compatibility of action inputs and outputs
            - Safe bash practices including robust quoting and clear error handling
            - Secret handling and masking throughout steps
            - Idempotency and deterministic behavior of composite actions
            - Correct commit SHA pinning for any referenced actions
            - PR titles follow conventional commit format
